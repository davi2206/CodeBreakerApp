    Code Cracker is a spare time project that I have been working on, for educational purposes. It is the first Android application that I have created.
    \n\nThe idea with the app is to be able to read and write various types of codes, such as Morse code, number codes, and a few other types.
    \n\nThis is an early version of the app, and only Morse code is implemented, so far.
